## MIU Programming Test Practice

This repository includes solutions for all the elementary programming questions which I solved while practicing for the entrance examination of MIU.

The questions were gathered from different sources: MIU official website and GitHub.

The primary programming language used for solving these questions is Java.

Everyday, I practise these questions for half an hour, and try to solve as many questions as I can within the given time period.

#HappyCoding :)
